# vim-vtc

Adds syntax highlighting for [Varnish Test Case files](https://varnish-cache.org/docs/trunk/reference/vtc.html) (`*.vtc`).

It's a very basic syntax highlighting file, feel free to improve on it.

## Installation

Pathogen:

```
git clone https://github.com/hed854/vim-vtc.git ~/.vim/bundle/vim-vtc
```
